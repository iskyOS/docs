This page provides an extended introduction to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) specifically for less technical audiences who are looking to better understand the technology and why it matters.

## What is MCP?

MCP makes it easy for AI applications to interact with tools and data sources.

Think of MCP as a universal adapter for AI applications, similar to what USB-C is for physical devices. USB-C acts as a universal adapter to connect devices to various peripherals and accessories. Similarly, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI applications to different data and tools. Just as USB-C means you don't need different cables for different devices, MCP means developers don't need bespoke integration methods for different data.

## Why does MCP matter?

MCP helps AI applications access and interact with your data and tools, so you can more easily build solutions to fit your own workflows. 

Without MCP, AI applications are typically limited to what they already knowâ€”they can't see your documents, your company's knowledge bases, or your project files. MCP breaks down these silos, allowing AI applications to connect with the information sources you use every day, making them more helpful and relevant to your specific workflows.  

For example, by using MCP servers, an AI assistant could access your personal documents to answer questions based on their contents, or access your calendar to suggest meeting times, all without needing bespoke API integrations for each tool.

MCP also adds value for the developers who best understand how to leverage tools. These developers can build MCP servers that expose best practices for working with tools, and the resulting MCP servers can be reused by any number of AI application builders. Since MCP is also model agnostic, it can be used with applications regardless of what LLM they are using.

## Why was MCP built?

Lots of companies and developers today are building AI applications. Prior to MCP being built, many developers were building bespoke ways of getting their applications and data sources to talk to one another.

Building MCP as an open source standard is meant to make it as easy as possible to build powerful and genuinely helpful AI applications. Creating an open source ecosystem of MCP servers also means that developers are able to build servers for their favorite tools and data sources and share those with other developers across the industry.
